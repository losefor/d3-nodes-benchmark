# Collapsible Tree Visualization with D3.js

This project provides a dynamic, zoomable, and collapsible tree visualization using **D3.js** and **Svelte**. The tree structure is fully interactive, allowing nodes to collapse and expand on click, and includes zoom and pan functionality for large datasets. The tree adjusts its layout based on node sizes, offering an optimized rendering for both small and large datasets.

## Features

- **Collapsible Nodes**: Click on any node to expand or collapse its children.
- **Zoom and Pan**: Supports zooming and panning to navigate large trees efficiently.
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adjusts the layout based on node sizes.
- **Optimized for Large Data**: Handles large datasets with many nodes and levels while maintaining a smooth user experience.
